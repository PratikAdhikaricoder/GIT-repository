## Merge Conflict Resolution

During the development of `feature-1` and `feature-2`, a merge conflict occurred in the `README.md` file. Below are the steps taken to resolve it:

1. Both branches modified the same section of `README.md`.
2. Upon merging `feature-2` into `main`, Git reported a conflict in the `README.md` file.
3. The conflicting section was:
   ```text
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   This is a change from feature-1
   =======
   This is a conflicting change from feature-2
   >>>>>>> feature-2

---

# **Summary**
1. A Git repository with a commit history.
2. Two branches (`feature-1` and `feature-2`) that modify the same file.
3. A documented process for resolving merge conflicts in `README.md`.
